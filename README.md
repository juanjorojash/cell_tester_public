### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository was created to be used in conjuction with the integrated system known as "Charger_discharger.V5". The latest . It was created to control the PIC16F1786 installed for feedback control and serial logging.
* Hardware version: Charger_discharger.V5
* PCB design files  located in **[repository directory]/pcb/**

### How do I get set up? ###

* Connect usign serial cable model "TTL-232R-5V-AJ". 
* **Serial terminal** Start with the following settings BR:57600 kbps, Data: 8 bit, Parity: none, Stop bits: 1, Flow control: none. Press "ESC" to restart and show the main menu. Set the desired configuration following the instructions.
* **LabView logger program** A program for receiving, saving and plotting the test data is included in the repository, in the directory **labview_logger/logger.exe**. The following programs are needed in order to run this program in a PC that **does not** have LabView installed:
	* [LabVIEW Run-Time Engine 2016 - (64-bit)](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-run-time-engine-2016/6067/en/) 
	* [NI-VISA Run-Time Engine 16.0](http://www.ni.com/download/ni-visa-run-time-engine-16.0/6188/en/)
The program creates the directory **c:/logger_data** to store the data.
